# ðŸ§® Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Practice

This repository contains my journey of learning and solving **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems from scratch to advanced.  
I am solving problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, **Codeforces**, and **HackerRank**.

## ðŸ“… Roadmap & Progress

### **Phase 1 â€“ Foundations**
- [x] Time Complexity & Space Complexity
- [x] Arrays (Traversal, Reverse, Min/Max, Kadane's Algorithm)
- [x] Strings (Palindrome, Anagrams, String Matching)
- [ ] Math Basics (GCD, LCM, Prime Numbers, Modular Arithmetic)

### **Phase 2 â€“ Searching, Sorting & Recursion**
- [ ] Searching (Linear, Binary Search)
- [ ] Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick)
- [ ] Recursion Basics
- [ ] Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver)

### **Phase 3 â€“ Linked List, Stack, Queue**
- [ ] Singly & Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Stack (Array & Linked List)
- [ ] Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Deque

### **Phase 4 â€“ Trees & Graphs**
- [ ] Binary Tree Traversals (DFS, BFS)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
- [ ] Heap (Min, Max)
- [ ] Graph BFS, DFS
- [ ] Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
- [ ] MST (Primâ€™s, Kruskalâ€™s)

### **Phase 5 â€“ Advanced Topics**
- [ ] Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LCS, LIS)
